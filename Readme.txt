->This Weather Application is built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
->To make it work, you need to create an API key on the OpenWeather website and enter that key in the 'apiKey' variable located in the "script.js" file.
->Please note that when entering a city name, you should include a space, such as [New York], rather than entering it as a single word (newyork).
